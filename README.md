# 📸 Camera Effect Playground

Camera Effect Playground is an experimental collection of HTML/CSS/JavaScript projects that explore **camera effects in the browser**.  
Each file (`Camera Effect Playground X.html`) represents a different iteration or experiment, where I tested new approaches and refined ideas.  

## 🚀 Features
- Multiple versions (v0, v1, v2, …) to show progression and experimentation
- Focus on applying creative camera effects directly in the browser
- Pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks required
- Lightweight and easy to open in any modern web browser


## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open any `.html` file in your browser.  
3. Play around with the effects and see how they change between versions.  

## 🎯 Purpose
This is not a polished final product — it’s a **learning playground**.  
The goal is to:
- Practice building visual camera effects
- Iterate quickly with small standalone versions
- Document the creative journey of experimentation  

## 🤝 Contributing / Reuse
